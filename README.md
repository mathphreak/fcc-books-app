# fcc-books-app

It's the books app from FreeCodeCamp. Based on clementine.js

## Room for Improvement
- Store users' location instead of city/state (violates spec)
- Go beyond technical adherence to spec for requests
  ('I can propose a trade and wait for the other user to accept the trade' doesn't include 'they can accept the trade')
- Provide messaging for following through with requests
- Track request creation dates
- Email notifications
